			<h2>Client Vehicle Report</h2>	
			<figcaption>The client facing report needed a facelift. After collaborating with the many internal and external users, I did rapid prototyping with Invision, iterated on the testing from there and made high fidelity designs, which we then went through some additional iterations. What came out is a much more functional and user friendly design. </figcaption>
